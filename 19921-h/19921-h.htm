<h2>PREHISTORIC TEXTILE ART OF EASTERN UNITED STATES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By W. H. Holmes</span></h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY.</h3>

<h4>SCOPE OF THE WORK.</h4>

<p>About the year 1890 the writer was requested by the Director of
the Bureau of Ethnology to prepare certain papers on aboriginal
art, to accompany the final report of Dr. Cyrus Thomas on his
explorations of mounds and other ancient remains in eastern United
States. These papers were to treat of those arts represented most
fully by relics recovered in the field explored. They included
studies of the art of pottery, of the textile art and of art in
shell, and a paper on native tobacco pipes. Three of these papers
were already completed when it was decided to issue the main work
of Dr. Thomas independently of the several papers prepared by his
associates. It thus happens that the present paper, written to form
a limited section of a work restricted to narrow geographic limits,
covers so small a fragment of the aboriginal textile field.</p>

<p>The materials considered in this paper include little not
germane to the studies conducted by Dr. Thomas in the mound region,
the collections used having been made largely by members of the
Bureau of Ethnology acting under his supervision. Two or three
papers have already been published in the annual reports of the
Bureau in which parts of the same collections have been utilized,
and a few of the illustrations prepared for these papers are
reproduced in this more comprehensive study.</p>

<p>Until within the last few years textile fabrics have hardly been
recognized as having a place among the materials to be utilized in
the discussion of North American archeology. Recent studies of the
art of the mound-building tribes have, however, served to
demonstrate their importance, and the evidence now furnished by
this art can be placed alongside of that of arts in clay, stone,
and metal, as a factor in determining the culture status of the
prehistoric peoples and in defining their relations to the historic
Indians. This change is due to the more <span class='pagenum'><a
name="pg010" id="pg010">010</a></span> careful investigations of
recent times, to the utilization of new lines of archeologic
research, and to the better knowledge of the character and scope of
historic and modern native art. A comparison of the textiles
obtained from ancient mounds and graves with the work of living
tribes has demonstrated their practical identity in materials, in
processes of manufacture, and in articles produced. Thus another
important link is added to the chain that binds together the
ancient and the modern tribes.</p>

<div class="center">DEFINITION OF THE ART.</div>

<p>The textile art dates back to the very inception of culture, and
its practice is next to universal among living peoples. In very
early stages of culture progress it embraced the stems of numerous
branches of industry afterward differentiated through the
utilization of other materials or through the employment of
distinct systems of construction. At all periods of cultural
development it has been a most indispensable art, and with some
peoples it has reached a marvelous perfection, both technically and
esthetically.</p>

<p>Woven fabrics include all those products of art in which the
elements or parts employed in construction are more or less
filamental, and are combined by methods conditioned chiefly by
their flexibility. The processes employed are known by such terms
as wattling, interlacing, plaiting, netting, weaving, sewing, and
embroidering.</p>

<div class="center">MATERIALS AND PROCESSES.</div>

<p>Viewing the entire textile field, we find that the range of
products is extremely wide. On the one hand there is the rude
interlacing of branches, vines, roots, and canes in constructing
houses, weirs, cages, rafts, bridges, and the like, and on the
other, the spinning of threads of almost microscopic fineness and
the weaving of textures of marvelous delicacy and beauty.</p>

<p>The more cultured peoples of Central America and South America
had accomplished wonders in the use of the loom and the embroidery
frame, but the work of the natives of the United States was on a
decidedly lower plane. In basketry and certain classes of
garment-making, the inhabitants of the Mississippi valley were well
advanced at the period of European conquest, and there is ample
evidence to show that the mound-building peoples were not behind
historic tribes in this matter. In many sections of our country the
art is still practiced, and with a technical perfection and an
artistic refinement of high order, as the splendid collections in
our museums amply show.</p>

<p>The degree of success in the textile art is not necessarily a
reliable index of the culture status of the peoples concerned, as
progress in a particular art depends much upon the encouragement
given to it by local features of environment. The tribe that had
good clay used <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg011" id=
"pg011">011</a></span> earthenware and neglected basketry, and the
community well supplied with skins of animals did not need to
undertake the difficult and laborious task of spinning fibers and
weaving garments and bedding. Thus it appears that well-advanced
peoples may have produced inferior textiles and that backward
tribes may have excelled in the art. Caution is necessary in using
the evidence furnished by the art to aid in determining relative
degrees of culture.</p>

<div class="center">SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</div>

<p>The failure of the textile art to secure a prominent place in
the field of archeologic evidence is due to the susceptibility of
the products to decay. Examples of archaic work survive to us only
by virtue of exceptionally favorable circumstances; it rarely
happened that mound fabrics were so conditioned, as the soil in
which they were buried is generally porous and moist; they were in
some cases preserved through contact with objects of copper, the
oxides of that metal having a tendency to arrest decay. The custom
of burial in caves and rock shelters has led to the preservation of
numerous fabrics through the agency of certain salts with which the
soil is charged. Preservation by charring is common, and it is held
by some that carbonization without the agency of fire has in some
cases taken place.</p>

<p>Considerable knowledge of the fabrics of the ancient North
American tribes is preserved in a way wholly distinct from the
preceding. The primitive potter employed woven textiles in the
manufacture of earthenware; during the processes of construction
the fabrics were impressed on the soft clay, and when the vessels
were baked the impressions became fixed. The study of these
impressions led to meager results until the idea was conceived of
taking castings from them in clay, wax, or paper; through this
device the negative impression becomes a positive reproduction and
the fabrics are shown in relief, every feature coming out with
surprising distinctness; it is possible even to discover the nature
of the threads employed and to detect the manner of their
combination.</p>

<p>Evidence of the practice of textile arts by many ancient nations
is preserved to us by such implements of weaving as happened to be
of enduring materials; spindle-whorls in clay and stone are perhaps
the most common of these relics. These objects tell us definitely
of the practice of the art, but give little insight into the
character of the products. It is a notable fact that evidence of
this class is almost wholly wanting in the United States;
spindle-whorls have in rare cases been reported from southern
localities, and a few writers have mentioned their use by modern
tribes.</p>

<p>It happens that in some cases we may learn something of the
progress made by vanished peoples in this art by a study of the
forms of such of their earthen vessels as were manifestly derived
from baskets, or <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg012" id=
"pg012">012</a></span> made in imitation of them. The ornamental art
of peoples well advanced in culture often bears evidence of the
influence of the system of combination of parts followed originally
in the textile arts, and little art, ancient or modern, in which
men have endeavored to embody beauty, is without strongly marked
traces of this influence. By the study of archaic ornament embodied
in clay, wood, and stone, therefore, the archeologist may hope to
add something to the sum of his knowledge of ancient textiles. It
should be noted that the pottery of the mound-builders shows less
evidence of the influence of textile forms than does that of most
other nations, and some groups of their ware appear to present no
recognizable traces of it whatever.</p>

<p>Although much information has been brought together from all of
the sources mentioned, it is not at all certain that we can form
anything like a complete or correct notion of the character and
scope of the art as practiced by the mound-builders. No doubt the
finest articles of apparel were often buried with the dead, but a
very small fraction only of the mortuary wrappings or costumes has
been preserved, and from vast areas once thickly inhabited by the
most advanced tribes nothing whatever has been collected. Of
embroideries, featherwork, and the like, so frequently mentioned by
early travelers, hardly a trace is left.</p>

<p>The relations of our historic tribes to the ancient peoples of
our continent and to all of the nations, ancient and modern, who
built mounds and earthworks, are now generally considered so
intimate that no objection can be raised to the utilization of the
accounts of early explorers in the elucidation of such features of
the art as archeology has failed to record. The first step in this
study may consist quite properly of a review of what is recorded of
the historic art. Subsequently the purely archeologic data will be
given.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="pg013" id="pg013">013</a></span></p>

<div class="center">PRODUCTS OF THE ART.</div>

<p>In undertaking to classify the textile fabrics of the mound
region it is found that, although there is an unbroken gradation
from the rudest and heaviest textile constructions to the most
delicate and refined textures, a number of well-marked divisions
may be made. The broadest of these is based on the use of spun as
opposed to unspun strands or parts, a classification corresponding
somewhat closely to the division into rigid and pliable forms.
Material, method of combination of parts, and function may each be
made the basis of classification, but for present purposes a simple
presentation of the whole body of products, beginning with the
rudest or most primitive forms and ending with the most elaborate
and artistic products, is sufficient. The material will be
presented in the following order: (1) Wattle work; (2) basketry;
(3) matting; (4) pliable fabrics or cloths.</p>

<div class="center">WATTLE WORK.</div>

<p>The term wattling is applied to such constructions as employ by
interlacing, plaiting, etc., somewhat heavy, rigid, or slightly
pliable parts, as rods, boughs, canes, and vines. Primitive
shelters and dwellings are very often constructed in this manner,
and rafts, cages, bridges, fish weirs, and inclosures of various
kinds were and still are made or partly made in this manner. As a
matter of course, few of these constructions are known to us save
through historic channels; but traces of wattle work are found in
the mounds of the lower Mississippi valley, where imprints of the
interlaced canes occur in the baked clay plaster with which the
dwellings were finished. When we consider the nature of the
materials at hand, and the close correspondence in habits and
customs of our prehistoric peoples with the tribes found living by
the earliest explorers and settlers, we naturally conclude that
this class of construction was very common at all known periods of
native American history.</p>

<p>The constructors of native dwellings generally employed pliable
branches or saplings, which are bound together with vines, twigs,
and other more pliable woody forms. John Smith says of the Indians
of Virginia<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Their houses are built like our Arbors, of small young springs
bowed and tyed, and so close covered with Mats, or the barkes of
trees very handsomely, that notwithstanding either winde, raine, or
weather, they are as warm as stooues, but very smoaky, yet at the
toppe of the house there is a hole made for the smoake to goe into
right over the fire.</p>
</div>


<p>Butel-Dumont also, in describing the dwellings of the Natchez
Indians of the lower Mississippi region, speaks of the door of an
Indian cabin "made of dried canes fastened and interlaced on two
other canes placed across."<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id=
"FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>A singular use of wattle work is mentioned by Lafitau. He states
that the young men, when going through the ordeal of initiation on
attaining their majority, were placed apart in&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>An inclosure very strongly built, made expressly for this
purpose, one of which I saw in 1694, which belonged to the Indians
of Pauma&uuml;nkie. It was in the form of a sugar loaf and was open
on all sides like a trellis to admit the air.<a name="FNanchor_2_3"
id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img width="100%" src="images/fig01.jpg"
alt="Fish weir of the Virginia Indiana (after Hariot)." /></div>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Fish
weir of the Virginia Indiana (after Hariot).</div>

<p>Of a somewhat similar nature was the construction of biers
described by Butel-Dumont. Speaking of the Mobilians, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>When their chief is dead they proceed as follows: At 15 or 20
feet from his cabin they erect a kind of platform raised about
4&frac12; feet from the ground. This is composed of four large forked
poles of oak wood planted in the earth, with others placed across;
this is covered with canes bound and interlaced so as to resemble
greatly the bed used by the natives.<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id=
"FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
</div>

<p>According to John Lawson, similarly constructed "hurdles" were
in use among the Carolina Indians.</p>

<p>The tide-water tribes of the Atlantic coast region made very
frequent use of fish weirs, which were essentially textile in
character. John Smith mentions their use in Virginia, and Hariot
gives a number of plates in which the weirs are delineated. The cut
here given (figure 1) <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg015" id=
"pg015">015</a></span>is from Hariot's plate XIII. It represents a
very elaborate trap; much simpler forms are shown in other plates.
Slender poles set in the shallow water are held in place by
wattling or interlacing of pliable parts.</p>


<p>It is probable that traps of similar character were used by the
mound-building tribes wherever the conditions were favorable. The
only apparent traces of such weirs yet found in any part of the
country are a number of stumps of stakes discovered by H. T. Cresson
in Delaware river near Wilmington, but these appear to be much
heavier than would have been used for the purpose by the
natives.</p>

<p>Another somewhat usual use of wattling is mentioned by various
authors. Butel-Dumont speaks of a raft made of poles and canes, and
Du Pratz, writing of the Louisiana Indians, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The conveniencies for passing rivers would soon be suggested to
them by the floating of wood upon the water. Accordingly one of
their methods of crossing rivers is upon floats of canes, which are
called by them Cajeu, and are formed in this manner. They cut a
great number of canes, which they tie up into faggots, part of
which they fasten together sideways, and over these they lay a few
crossways, binding all close together, and then launching it into
the water.<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We learn from various authors that cage-like coffins were
constructed of canes and reeds something after the wattle style;
and hampers, cages for animals, chests for treasures or regalia,
biers, carrying chairs, fish baskets, beds and seats were often
similarly made. These articles, being generally light and portable,
and constructed of delicate parts, can as well be classed with
basketry as with wattle work.</p>

<div class="center">BASKETRY.</div>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Types of
Basketry.</span></div>

<p>Perhaps no branch of the textile art was of greater importance
to the aborigines than basketry. This term may be made to cover all
woven articles of a portable kind which have sufficient rigidity to
retain definite or stable form without distention by contents or by
other extraneous form of support. It will readily be seen that in
shape, texture, use, size, etc., a very wide range of products is
here to be considered. Basketry includes a number of groups of
utensils distinguished from one another by the use to which they
are devoted. There are baskets proper, hampers, cradles, shields,
quivers, sieves, etc. There is frequent historical mention of the
use of basketry, but the descriptions of form and construction are
meager. An excellent idea of the ancient art can be gained from the
art of the present time, and there is every reason to believe that
close correspondence exists throughout.</p>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Baskets.</span></div>

<p>Lawson refers to basket-making and other textile arts of the
Carolina Indians in the following language:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Indian women's work is to cook the victuals for the whole
family, and to make mats, baskets, girdles, of possum hair, and
such like. * * * <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg016" id=
"pg016">016</a></span> The mats the Indian women make are of rushes,
and about five feet high, and two fathom long, and sewed double,
that is, two together; whereby they become very commodious to lay
under our beds, or to sleep on in the summer season in the day
time, and for our slaves in the night.</p>
</div>

<p>There are other mats made of flags, which the Tuskeruro Indians
make, and sell to the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The baskets our neighboring Indians make are all made of a very
fine sort of bullrushes, and sometimes of silk grass, which they
work with figures of beasts, birds, fishes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A great way up in the country, both baskets and mats are made of
the split reeds, which are only the outward shining part of the
cane. Of these I have seen mats, baskets, and dressing boxes, very
artificially done.<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a
href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>James Adair, although, a comparatively recent writer, gives such
definite and valuable information regarding the handiwork of the
Southern Indians that the following extracts may well be made.
Speaking of the Cherokees, he remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>They make the handsomest clothes baskets, I ever saw,
considering their materials. They divide large swamp canes, into
long, thin, narrow splinters, which they dye of several colours,
and manage the workmanship so well, that both the inside and
outside are covered with a beautiful variety of pleasing figures;
and, though for the space of two inches below the upper edge of
each basket, it is worked into one, through the other parts they
are worked asunder, as if they were two joined a-top by some strong
cement. A large nest consists of eight or ten baskets, contained
within each other. Their dimensions are different, but they usually
make the outside basket about a foot deep, a foot and an half
broad, and almost a yard long.<a name="FNanchor_2_7" id=
"FNanchor_2_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_7" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This statement could in most respects be made with equal truth
and propriety of the Cherokee work of the present time; and their
pre-Columbian art must have been even more pleasing, as the
following paragraph suggests:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Indians, by reason of our supplying them so cheap with every
sort of goods, have forgotten the chief part of their ancient
mechanical skill, so as not to be well able now, at least for some
years, to live independent of us. Formerly, those baskets which the
Cheerake made, were so highly esteemed even in South Carolina, the
politest of our colonies, for domestic usefulness, beauty, and
skilful variety, that a large nest of them cost upwards of a
moidore.<a name="FNanchor_3_8" id="FNanchor_3_8"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_3_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
</div>

<p>That there was much uniformity in the processes and range of
products and uses throughout the country is apparent from
statements made by numerous writers. Speaking of the Louisiana
Indians, Du Pratz says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The women likewise make a kind of hampers to carry corn, flesh,
fish, or any other thing which they want to transport from one
place to another; they are round, deeper than broad, and of all
sizes. * * * They make baskets with long lids that roll doubly over
them, and in these they place their earrings and pendants, their
bracelets, garters, their ribbands for their hair, and their
vermillion for painting themselves, if they have any, but when they
have no vermillion they boil ochre, and paint themselves with
that.<a name="FNanchor_4_9" id="FNanchor_4_9"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_4_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
</div>


<p>It happens that few baskets have been recovered from mounds and
graves, but they are occasionally reported as having been
discovered in <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg017" id=
"pg017">017</a></span>caverns and shelters where conditions were
especially favorable to their preservation. Such specimens may as
reasonably be attributed to the mound-building as to the other
Indians. The following statement is from John Haywood:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>On the south side of Cumberland river, about 22 miles above
Cairo, * * * is a cave * * *. In this room, near about the center,
were found sitting in baskets made of cane, three human bodies; the
flesh entire, but a little shrivelled, and not much so. The bodies
were those of a man, a female and a small child. The complexion of
all was very fair, and white, without any intermixture of the
copper colour. Their eyes were blue; their hair auburn, and fine.
The teeth were very white, their stature was delicate, about the
size of the whites of the present day. The man was wrapped in 14
dressed deer skins. The 14 deer skins were wrapped in what those
present called blankets. They were made of bark, like those found
in the cave in White county. The form of the baskets which inclosed
them, was pyramidal, being larger at the bottom, and declining to
the top. The heads of the skeletons, from the neck, were above the
summits of the blankets.<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id=
"FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Sieves and
Strainers.</span></div>

<p>It is apparent that baskets of open construction were employed
as sieves in pre-Columbian as well as in post-Columbian times.
Almost any basket could be utilized on occasion for separating fine
from coarse particles of food or other pulverulent substances, but
special forms were sometimes made for the purpose, having varying
degrees of refinement to suit the material to be separated.</p>

<p>Bartram mentions the use of a sieve by the Georgia Indians in
straining a "cooling sort of jelly" called conti, made by pounding
certain roots in a mortar and adding water.</p>

<p>Butel-Dumont describes the sieves and winnowing fans of the
Louisiana Indians. The Indian women, he says, make very fine
sieves&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>With the skin which they take off of the canes; they also make
some with larger holes, which serve as bolters, and still others
without holes, to be used as winnowing fans. * * * They also make
baskets very neatly fashioned, cradles for holding maize; and with
the tail feathers of turkeys, which they have much skill in
arranging, they make fans not only for their own use, but which
even our French women do not disdain to use.<a name="FNanchor_1_11"
id="FNanchor_1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Le Page Du Pratz says that "for sifting the flour of their maiz,
and for other uses, the natives make sieves of various finenesses
of the splits of cane;"<a name="FNanchor_2_12" id=
"FNanchor_2_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_12" class=
"fnanchor">[12]</a> and a similar use by the Indians of Virginia is
recorded by John Smith:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>They use a small basket for their Temmes, then pound againe the
great, and so separating by dashing their hand in the basket,
receive the flowr in a platter of wood scraped to that forme with
burning and shels.<a name="FNanchor_3_13" id="FNanchor_3_13"></a><a
href="#Footnote_3_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
</div>

<p>From Hakluyt we have the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Their old wheat they firste steepe a night in hot water, and in
the morning pounding yt in a morter, they use a small baskett for
the boulter or searser, and when <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"pg018" id="pg018">018</a></span>they have syfted fourth the finest,
they pound againe the great, and so separating yt by dashing their
hand in the baskett, receave the flower in a platter of wood,
which, blending with water, etc.<a name="FNanchor_4_14" id=
"FNanchor_4_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_14" class=
"fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
</div>



<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Cradles.</span></div>

<p>That cradles of textile construction were used by the
mound-builders may be taken for granted. The following is from Du
Pratz, who is speaking of the work of the inhabitants of the lower
Mississippi:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This cradle is about two feet and a half long, nine inches
broad. It is skillfully made of straight canes of the length
desired for the cradle, and at the end they are cut in half and
doubled under to form the foot. The whole is only half a foot high.
This cradle is very light, weighing only two pounds. * * * The

<div class="center">MATTING.</div>

<p>No class of articles of textile nature were more universally
employed by the aborigines than mats of split cane, rushes, and
reeds, and our information, derived from literature and from such
remnants of the articles themselves as have been recovered from
graves and caves, is quite full and satisfactory. Mats are not so
varied in form and character as are baskets, but their uses were
greatly diversified; they served for carpeting, seats, hangings,
coverings, and wrappings, and they were extensively employed in
permanent house construction, and for temporary or movable
shelters. A few brief extracts will serve to indicate their use in
various classes of construction by the tribes first encountered by
the whites.</p>

<p>Hariot says that the houses of the Virginia Indians&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Are made of small poles made fast at the tops in rounde forme
after the maner as is vsed in many arbories in our gardens of
England, in most townes couered with barkes, and in some with
artificiall mattes made of long rushes; from the tops of the houses
downe to the ground.<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id=

<p>It would appear from a study of the numerous illustrations of
houses given by this author that the mats so often referred to were
identical <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg019" id=
"pg019">019</a></span> in construction with those still in use among
the tribes of the upper Mississippi and the far west. The rushes
are laid close together side by side and bound together at long
intervals by cords intertwined across. In <i>e</i>, plate I, is
reproduced a small portion of a mat from Hariot's engraving of the
dead-house of the Virginia Indians, which shows this method of
construction.</p>

<p>The modern use of mats of this class in house construction is
known by an example which I have seen represented in a small
photograph, taken about the year 1868, and representing a Chippewa
village, situated somewhere in the upper Missouri valley, probably
not far from Sioux City, Iowa.</p>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Use
of mats in an Indian council (after Lafitau).</div>

<p>Mats were used not only in and about the dwellings of the
aborigines, but it was a common practice to carry them from place
to place to sleep on, or for use as seats or carpeting in meetings
or councils of ceremonious nature. The latter use is illustrated in
a number of the early accounts of the natives. Figure 2, copied
from Lafitau, serves to indicate the common practice.</p>

<p>The omnipresent sweat-house of the aborigines is thus described
by Smith:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Sometimes they are troubled with dropsies, swellings, aches, and
such like diseases; for cure whereof they build a Stone in the
forme of a Doue-house with mats, so close that a few coales therein
covered with a pot, will make the patient sweat extreamely.<a name=

class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Bartram, speaking of the Seminoles, states that the wide steps
leading up to the canopied platform of the council house are
"covered with carpets or mats, curiously woven of split canes dyed
of various colours."<a name="FNanchor_2_19" id=
"FNanchor_2_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_19" class=
"fnanchor">[19]</a></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="pg020" id="pg020">020</a></span>The
use of mats in the mound country in very early times is described
by Joutel as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Their moveables are some bullocks' hides and goat skins well
cured, some mats close wove, wherewith they adorn their huts, and
some earthen vessels which they are very skilful at making, and
wherein they boil their flesh or roots, or sagamis&eacute;, which,
as has been said, is their pottage. They have also some small
baskets made of canes, serving to put in their fruit and other
provisions. Their beds are made of canes, raised 2 or 3 feet above
the ground, handsomely fitted with mats and bullocks' hides, or
goat skins well cured, which serve them for feather beds, or quilts
and blankets; and those beds are parted one from another by mats
hung up.<a name="FNanchor_2_21" id="FNanchor_2_21"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_2_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The mats so much used for beds and carpets and for the covering
of shelters, houses, etc., were probably made of pliable materials
such as rushes. De la Potherie illustrates their use as beds,<a
name="FNanchor_1_20" id="FNanchor_1_20"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> one end of the mat being
rolled up for a pillow as shown in figure 3.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img width="100%" src="images/fig03.jpg"
alt="Use of mat in sleeping (after De la Potherie)." /></div>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Use
of mat in sleeping (after De la Potherie).</div>

<p>The sizes of mats were greatly varied; the smallest were
sufficient for seating only a single person, but the largest were
many yards in length, the width being restricted to a few feet by
the conditions of construction.</p>

<p>Mats were woven in two or more styles. Where the strands or
parts were uniform in size and rigidity they were simply
interlaced, but when one strong or rigid series was to be kept in
place by a pliable series, the latter were twisted about the former
at the intersections as in ordinary twined weaving. The heavy
series of strands or parts were held together side by side by the
intertwined strands placed far apart, a common practice yet among
native mat-makers. Much variety of character and appearance was
given to the fabric by varying the order of the strands in
intersection. It was a common practice to interweave strands of
different size, shape, or color, thus producing borders and
patterns of no little beauty. Du Pratz thus mentions the use of
dyes by the Louisiana Indians: "The women sometimes add to this
furniture of the bed mats woven of cane, dyed of 3 colours, which
colours in the weaving are formed into various figures."<a name=
"FNanchor_3_22" id="FNanchor_3_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_22"
class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This is well illustrated <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="pg021" id="pg021">021</a></span>in the mat from a
rock shelter in Tennessee, later to be described, and the Indians
of the east and north practiced the same art.</p>

<p>Speaking of the ceremony of smoking the calumet among the
Iroquois, De la Potherie says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The ceremony is held in a large cabin in winter and in summer in
an open field. The place being chosen, it is surrounded with
branches to shade the company. In the center is spread a large mat
of canes dyed in various colors, which serves as a carpet.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_23" id="FNanchor_1_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Frequent mention is made of the use of mats in burial. Two brief
extracts will serve to illustrate this use. Butel-Dumont makes the
following statement regarding tribes of the lower Mississippi:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Paskagoulas and Billoxis do not inter their chief when he
dies, but they dry the corpse with fire and smoke in such a way
that it becomes a mere skeleton. After it is reduced to this state
they carry it to the temple (for they have one as well as the
Natchez) and put it in the place of its predecessor, which they
take from the spot it occupied and place it with the bodies of the
other chiefs at the bottom of the temple, where they are arranged
one after the other, standing upright like statues. As for the
newly deceased, he is exposed at the entrance of the temple on a
sort of altar or table made of cane and covered with a fine mat
very neatly worked in red and yellow squares with the skin of the
canes.<a name="FNanchor_2_24" id="FNanchor_2_24"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_2_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Brackenridge<a name="FNanchor_3_25" id="FNanchor_3_25"></a><a
href="#Footnote_3_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> says that a few
years ago, in the state of Tennessee, "Two human bodies were found
in a copperas cave in a surprising state of preservation. They were
first wrapped up in a kind of blanket, supposed to have been
manufactured of the lint of nettles, afterwards with dressed skins,
and then a mat of nearly 60 yards in length."</p>

<div class="center">PLIABLE FABRICS.</div>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Development of Spinning
and Weaving</span></div>

<p>The use of simple strands or parts in textile art precedes the
use of spun threads, but the one use leads very naturally up to the
other. In employing rushes, stems, grasses, etc., the smaller
strands were doubled to secure uniformity of size, and when a
number of parts were used they were combined into one by twisting
or plaiting. In time the advantage in strength and pliability of
twisted strands came to be recognized, and this led to the general
utilization of fibrous substances, and finally to the manufacture
of suitable fibers by manipulating the bark of trees and plants.
Spinning was probably not devised until the weaver's art had made
considerable advance, but its invention opened a new and broad
field and led to the development of a magnificent industry.
Semi-rigid fabrics served for a wide range of uses, as already
described, but soft and pliable cloths for personal use and
ornament were made possible only by the introduction of
spinning.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the whites the native art was well advanced;
thread, cordage, and even ropes of considerable weight were made
with <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg022" id="pg022">022</a></span>a
degree of uniformity and refinement that surprises us. The finest
threads with which I am acquainted are perhaps not as fine as our
no. 10 ordinary spool cotton thread, but we are not justified in
assuming that more refined work was not done. What we have is only
that which happened to be preserved through burial with the dead or
by impression on the plastic surface of clay used in the arts.</p>

<p>The materials employed for spinning by the aborigines were
greatly diversified. Through historical as well as through purely
archeologic sources we learn that both vegetal and animal filaments
and fibers were freely used. The inner bark of the mulberry was a
favorite material, but other fibrous barks were utilized. Wild
hemp, nettles, grasses, and other like growths furnished much of
the finer fibers. The hackling was accomplished by means of the
simplest devices, such as pounding with hammers or sticks. The hair
and sinews of animals were frequently spun into threads and woven
into cloth.</p>

<p>A few citations from early authors will indicate sufficiently
for present purposes the methods of spinning and weaving employed
by tribes which, if not in all cases mound-builders, were at least
the neighbors and relatives of the mound-building Indians.</p>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Cloths.</span></div>

<p>The character of the woven articles is to a great extent
indicated in the extracts which follow. It evidently was not
customary to weave "piece" goods, but rather to make separate units
of costumes, furnishing, etc., for use without cutting, fitting,
and sewing. Each piece was practically complete when it came from
the frame or loom. For clothing and personal use there were
mantles, shawls, and cloaks to be worn over one or both shoulders
or about the body as described by Hariot, Smith, the Knight of
Elvas, Du Pratz, and others; there were skirts fastened about the
waist and drawn with an inserted cord or looped over a belt; there
were belts, sashes, garters, shot pouches, and bags. For household
use there were hangings, covers for various articles, and
bedclothing; there were nets for fishing and cords for angling.
Some of these extracts describe the whole group of activities
included in the practice of the art as well as the use of the
products. I have considered it preferable to quote as a unit all
that is said on the subject by each author, giving cross reference,
when necessary, in discussing particular topics under other
headings.</p>

<p>Weaving among the Indians of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York,
and the northeast is described by Kalm, De la Potherie, and others.
The following extracts are from Kalm, and will serve to indicate
the status of the art over a wide area:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Apocynum cannabinum</i> was by the Swedes called Hemp of the
Indians; and grew plentifully in old corn grounds, in woods on
hills, and in high glades. The Swedes had given it the name of
Indian hemp, because the Indians formerly, and even now, apply it
to the same purposes as the Europeans do hemp; for the stalk may be
divided into filaments, and is easily prepared. When the Indians
were yet settled among <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg023" id=
"pg023">023</a></span> the Swedes, in Pensylvania and New Jersey,
they made ropes of this apocynum, which the Swedes bought, and
employed them as bridles, and for nets. These ropes were stronger,
and kept longer in water, than such as were made of common hemp.
The Swedes commonly got fourteen yards of these ropes for one piece
of bread. Many of the Europeans still buy such ropes, because they
last so well. The Indians likewise make several other stuffs of
their hemp. On my journey through the country of the Iroquese, I
saw the women employed in manufacturing this hemp. They made use
neither of spinning wheels nor distaffs, but rolled the filaments
upon their bare thighs, and made thread and strings of them, which
they dyed red, yellow, black, etc., and afterwards worked them into
stuffs, with a great deal of ingenuity. The plant is perennial,
which renders the annual planting of it altogether unnecessary. Out
of the root and stalk of this plant, when it is fresh, comes a
white milky juice, which is somewhat poisonous. Sometimes the
fishing tackle of the Indians consists entirely of this hemp. The
Europeans make no use of it, that I know of.<a name="FNanchor_1_26"
id="FNanchor_1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_26" class=
"fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In another place this author describes the weaving of bark
fibers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The <i>Direa palustris</i>, or Mouse-wood, is a little shrub
which grows on hills, towards swamps and marshes, and was now in
full blossom. The English in Albany call it Leather-wood, because
its bark is as tough as leather. The French in Canada call it Bois
de Plomb, or Leaden-wood because the wood itself is as soft and as
tough as lead. The bark of this shrub was made use of for ropes,
baskets, etc., by the Indians, whilst they lived among the Swedes.
And it is really very fit for that purpose, on account of its
remarkable strength, and toughness, which is equal to that of the
Lime-tree bark. The English and the Dutch in many parts of North
America, and the French in Canada, employ this bark in all cases
where we make use of Lime-tree bark in Europe. The tree itself is
very tough, and you cannot easily separate its branches without the
help of a knife: some people employ the twigs for rods.<a name=
"FNanchor_2_27" id="FNanchor_2_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
</div>

<p>De la Potherie, who wrote at an earlier date than Kalm,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The women spin on their knees, twisting the thread with the palm
of the hand; they make this thread, which should rather be called
twine (fisselle), into little balls.<a name="FNanchor_3_28" id=
"FNanchor_3_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_28" class=
"fnanchor">[28]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Hariot, John Smith, and Adair bear witness to the primitive
practice of the art in Virginia and the Carolinas. Smith uses the
following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Betwixt their hands and thighes, their women vse to spin, the
barkes of trees, Deere sinewes, or a kinde of grasse they call
Pemmenaw, of these they make a thread very even and readily. This
thread serveth for many vses. As about their housing apparell, as
also they make nets for fishing, for the quantitie as formally
braded as ours. They make also with it lines for angles.<a name=
"FNanchor_4_29" id="FNanchor_4_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Cherokees and other Indians with whom Adair came in contact
preserved in their purity many of the ancient practices. The
following extracts are, therefore, of much importance to the
historian of the textile art in America:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Formerly, the Indians made very handsome carpets. They have a
wild hemp that grows about six feet high, in open, rich, level
lands, and which usually ripens in July: it is plenty on our
frontier settlements. When it is fit for use, they pull, steep,
peel, and beat it; and the old women spin it off the distaffs, with
wooden machines, having some clay on the middle of them, to hasten
the motion. When the <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg024" id=
"pg024">024</a></span>coarse thread is prepared, they put it into a
frame about six feet square, and instead of a shuttle, they thrust
through the thread with a long cane, having a large string through
the web, which they shift at every second course of the thread.
When they have thus finished their arduous labour, they paint each
side of the carpet with such figures, of various colours, as their
fruitful imaginations devise; particularly the images of those
birds and beasts they are acquainted with; and likewise of
themselves, acting in their social, and martial stations. There is
that due proportion and so much wild variety in the design, that
would really strike a curious eye with pleasure and admiration. J.
W&mdash;t, Esq., a most skilful linguist in the Muskohge dialect,
assures me, that time out of mind they passed the woof with a
shuttle; and they have a couple of threddles, which they move with
the hand so as to enable them to make good dispatch, something
after our manner of weaving. This is sufficiently confirmed by
their method of working broad garters, sashes, shot pouches, broad
belts, and the like, which are decorated all over with beautiful
stripes and chequers.</p>

<p>The women are the chief, if not the only, manufacturers; the men
judge that if they performed that office, it would exceedingly
depreciate them. * * * In the winter season, the women gather
buffalo's hair, a sort of coarse, brown, curled wool; and having
spun it as fine as they can, and properly doubled it, they put
small beads of different colours upon the yarn, as they work it,
the figures they work in those small webs, are generally uniform,
but sometimes they diversify them on both sides. The Choktah weave
shot-pouches which have raised work inside and outside. They
likewise make turkey feather blankets with the long feathers of the
neck and breast of that large fowl&mdash;they twist the inner end
of the feathers very fast into a strong double thread of hemp, or
the inner bark of the mulberry tree, of the size and strength of
coarse twine, as the fibres are sufficiently fine, and they work it
in manner of fine netting. As the feathers are long and glittering,
this sort of blankets is not only very warm, but pleasing to the
eye.<a name="FNanchor_1_30" id="FNanchor_1_30"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The extent and importance of the art among the Gulf tribes are
indicated by a number of early observers. The Knight of Elvas
speaks of the use of blankets by the Indians, 83 degrees west
longitude, and 32 degrees north latitude, or near the central
portion of Georgia:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>These are like shawls, some of them are made from the inner
barks of trees, and others from a grass resembling nettle, which,
by threading out, becomes like flax. The women use them for
covering, wearing one about the body from the waist downward, and
another over the shoulder, with the right arm left free, after the
manner of the gypsies: the men wear but one, which they carry over
their shoulders in the same way, the loins being covered with a
bragueiro of deer-skin, after the fashion of the woolen
breech-cloth that was once the custom of Spain. The skins are well
dressed, the color being given to them that is wished, and in such
perfection, that, when of vermilion, they look like very fine red
broadcloth, and when black, the sort in use for shoes, they are of
the purest. The same hues are given to blankets.<a name=
"FNanchor_2_31" id="FNanchor_2_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
</div>

<p>At Cutifachiqui similar fabrics were observed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In the barbacoas were large quantities of clothing, shawls of
thread, made from the barks of trees and others of feathers, white
gray, vermilion and yellow, rich and proper for winter.<a name=
"FNanchor_3_32" id="FNanchor_3_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_32"
class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The frequent mention of fabrics used by the Indians for shawls,
mantles, etc., makes it plain that such were in very general use
when <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg025" id=
"pg025">025</a></span>the town of Pacaha was captured, and the
Spaniards clothed themselves with mantles, cassocks, and gowns made
from these native garments. Everywhere woven shawls were a
principal feature of the propitiatory gifts of the natives to the
Spaniards.</p>

<p>The extent of this manufacture of hempen garments by the Indians
of the lower Mississippi is well indicated in the account of the
adventures of the expedition on the western side of the Mississippi
at Aminoga. The Spaniards undertook the construction of brigantines
by means of which they hoped to descend the Mississippi and to pass
along the gulf coast to Mexico. A demand was made upon the natives
for shawls to be used in the manufacture of sails, and great
numbers were brought. Native hemp and the ravelings of shawls were
used for calking the boats.<a name="FNanchor_1_33" id=
"FNanchor_1_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_33" class=
"fnanchor">[33]</a> What a novel sight must have been this first
European fleet on the great river, consisting of five brigantines
impelled by sails of native manufacture!</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that in this region (of the lower
Mississippi) the Spaniards saw shawls of cotton, brought, it was
said, from the west&mdash;probably the Pueblo country, as they were
accompanied by objects that from the description may have been
ornaments of turquois.<a name="FNanchor_2_34" id=
"FNanchor_2_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_34" class=
"fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The following is from Du Pratz:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Many of the women wear cloaks of the bark of the mulberry-tree,
or of the feathers of swans, turkies, or India ducks. The bark they
take from young mulberry shoots that rise from the roots of trees
that have been cut down; after it is dried in the sun they beat it
to make all the woody part fall off, and they give the threads that
remain a second beating, after which they bleach them by exposing
them to the dew. When they are well whitened they spin them about
the coarseness of pack-thread, and weave them in the following
manner: they plant two stakes in the ground about a yard and a half
asunder, and having stretched a cord from the one to the other,
they fasten their threads of bark double to this cord, and then
interweave them in a curious manner into a cloak of about a yard
square with a wrought border round the edges. * * * The girls at
the age of eight or ten put on a little petticoat, which is a kind
of fringe made of threads of mulberry bark.<a name="FNanchor_3_35"
id="FNanchor_3_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_35" class=
"fnanchor">[35]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This is illustrated farther on.</p>

<p>The manner of weaving in the middle and upper Mississippi
country is described by Hunter, who, speaking of the Osage Indians
and their neighbors, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The hair of the buffalo and other animals is sometimes
manufactured into blankets; the hair is first twisted by hand, and
wound into balls. The warp is then laid of a length to answer the
size of the intended blanket, crossed by three small smooth rods
alternately beneath the threads, and secured at each end to
stronger rods supported on forks, at a short distance above the
ground. Thus prepared, the woof is filled in, thread by thread, and
pressed closely together, by means of a long flattened wooden
needle. When the weaving is finished, the ends of the warp and woof
are <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg026" id=
"pg026">026</a></span>tied into knots, and the blanket is ready for
use. In the same manner they construct mats from flags and rushes,
on which, particularly in warm weather, they sleep and sit.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_36" id="FNanchor_1_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Fabrics of various kinds were employed in burial, although not
generally made for that purpose. The wrappings of dead bodies were
often very elaborate, and the consignment of these to tombs and
graves where the conditions were favorable to preservation has kept
them for long periods in a most perfect state. By exhumation we
have obtained most of our information on this subject. Our
knowledge is, however, greatly increased by descriptions of such
burial customs as were witnessed in early times. Extracts already
given refer to the use of fabrics in mortuary customs. Many others
could be cited but the following seems sufficient:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>After the dead person has lain a day and a night in one of their
hurdles of canes, commonly in some out house made for that purpose,
those that officiate about the funeral go into the town, and the
first young men they meet withal, that have blankets or match coats
on, whom they think fit for their turn, they strip them from their
backs, who suffer them so to do without any resistance. In these
they wrap the dead bodies, and cover them with two or three mats
which the Indians make of rushes or cane; and, last of all, they
have a long web of woven reeds or hollow canes, which is the coffin
of the Indians, and is brought round several times and tied fast at
both ends, which, indeed, looks very decent and well. Then the
corps is brought out of the house into the orchard of peach trees,
where another hurdle is made to receive it, about which comes all
the relations and nation that the dead person belonged to, besides
several from other nations in alliance with them; all which sit
down on the ground upon mats spread there for that purpose.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_37" id="FNanchor_1_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_37"
class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Nets.</span></div>

<p>The manufacture and use of nets by natives in various parts of
the country are recorded by early writers, some of whom have
already been quoted. Speaking of the Iroquois De la Potherie
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The old men and those who can not or do not wish to go to war or
the chase, make nets and are fishers. This is a plebian trade among
them. Their nets are made of thread of nettles or of white wood,
the bark of which they make into thread by means of lye which
renders it strong and pliable.<a name="FNanchor_1_38" id=
"FNanchor_1_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_38" class=
"fnanchor">[38]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In another place the same author says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Sauteurs, who are beyond the Missisakis, take their name
from a Saut (waterfall) which flows from Lake Superior into Lake
Huron by a great fall whose rapids are extremely violent. These
people are very skillful in fishery by which they obtain white fish
as large as salmons. They cross all these terrible rapids into
which they cast a net like a sack, a little more than half an ell
in width by one in depth attached to a forked stick about 15 feet
long.<a name="FNanchor_2_39" id="FNanchor_2_39"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_2_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
</div>

<p>A novel use of nets is recorded by this author as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>For taking pigeons in summer in nets, they make a broad path in
the woods and attach to two trees, one on each side, a large net
made in the shape of a sack well opened.<a name="FNanchor_3_40" id=
"FNanchor_3_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_40" class=
"fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="pg027" id="pg027">027</a></span>Du
Pratz, speaking of the fishing nets of the Louisiana Indians,
states that they "are meshed like ours and made of lime-tree bark;
the large fish are shot with arrows."<a name="FNanchor_4_41" id=
"FNanchor_4_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_41" class=
"fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Feather Work.</span></div>

<p>Feather work was one of the most remarkable arts of the natives
of Mexico and other southern countries at the period of the
conquest. The feathers were sometimes woven in with the woof and
sometimes applied to a network base after the fashion of
embroidery. Rarely, it may be imagined, were either spun or unspun
fabrics woven of feathers alone. Very pleasing specimens of ancient
Peruvian feather work are recovered from graves at Ancon and
elsewhere, and the method of inserting the feathers is illustrated
in the Sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology.<a name=
"FNanchor_1_42" id="FNanchor_1_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_42"
class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In few instances has such work been
recovered from mounds or burial places, but there can be no doubt
that the mound-building tribes were experts in this art. Frequent
mention is made of the feather work of the natives by the earliest
explorers of the Mississippi valley, and the character of the work
may be gathered from the extracts already given and from those
which follow.</p>

<p>John Smith, speaking of the feather work of the Virginia
Indians, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We haue seene some vse mantels made of Turky feathers, so
prettily wrought and woven with threads that nothing could be
discerned but the feathers.<a name="FNanchor_2_43" id=
"FNanchor_2_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_43" class=
"fnanchor">[43]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Lawson mentions a "doctor" of the Santee nation who "was warmly
and neatly clad with a match coat, made of turkies feathers, which
makes a pretty show, seeming as if it was a garment of the deepest
silk shag."<a name="FNanchor_3_44" id="FNanchor_3_44"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_3_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>In another place the same author says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Their feather match coats are very pretty, especially some of
them, which are made extraordinary charming, containing several
pretty figures wrought in feathers, making them seem like a fine
flower silk shag; and when new and fresh, they become a bed very
well, instead of a quilt. Some of another sort are made of hair,
raccoon, bever, or squirrel skins, which are very warm. Others
again are made of the greenpart of the skin of a mallard's head,
which they sew perfectly well together, their thread being either
the sinews of a deer divided very small, or silk grass. When these
are finished, they look very finely, though they must needs be very
troublesome to make.<a name="FNanchor_4_45" id=
"FNanchor_4_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_45" class=
"fnanchor">[45]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Du Pratz thus describes the art in Louisiana:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>If the women know how to do this kind of work they make mantles
either of feathers or woven of the bark of the mulberry tree. We
will describe their method of doing this. The feather mantles are
made on a frame similar to that on which the peruke makers work
hair; they spread the feathers in the same manner and fasten them
on old fish nets or old mantles of mulberry bark. They are placed,
spread in this manner, one over the other and on both sides; for
this purpose small turkey feathers are used; women who have
feathers of swans or India ducks, which are white, make these
feather mantles for women of high rank.<a name="FNanchor_5_46" id=
"FNanchor_5_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_46" class=
"fnanchor">[46]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="pg028" id=
"pg028">028</a></span>Butel-Dumont describes feather work of the
natives of Louisiana briefly as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>They [the women] also, without a spinning wheel or distaff, spin
the hair or wool of cattle of which they make garters and ribands;
and with the thread which they obtain from lime-tree bark, they
make a species of mantle, which they cover with the finest swan's
feathers fastened one by one to the material. A long task indeed,
but they do not count this trouble and time when it concerns their
satisfaction.<a name="FNanchor_1_47" id="FNanchor_1_47"></a><a
href="#Footnote_1_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Embroidery.</span></div>

<p>The use of beads, quills, and other articles to beautify the
surfaces of fabrics and skins was as common, no doubt, with the
ancient as with the modern native inhabitants of the Mississippi
valley. In discoursing on the dress of native women of Louisiana
Butel-Dumont says that the young girls wear&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>* * * a sort of network attached to the waist and terminating in
a point, * * * both sides of which are ornamented with ribbons of
thread made from lime-tree fiber, also made into network. From the
waist to the knees hang several cords of the same thread, to the
ends of which are attached claws of birds of prey, such as eaglets,
crows, etc., so that when the girls walk these make a rattling
noise which is highly pleasing to them. This kind of ornament does
not illy resemble those nets which we use to cover our horses to
protect them from flies.<a name="FNanchor_2_48" id=
"FNanchor_2_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_48" class=
"fnanchor">[48]</a></p>
</div>

<p>From Du Pratz we have the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The women make also designs in embroidery with the skin of the
porcupine; they remove for this purpose the skin of this animal,
which is white and black; they split it very fine to use as
embroidery thread, dye a part of the white skin a red color,
another part yellow, and a third part is left white; they usually
work on black skin, and dye the black a reddish brown; but if they
work on bark, the black [threads] remain the same. Their designs
are very similar to some of those found in Gothic architecture;
they are composed of straight lines which form right angles at
their conjunction, which is commonly called the corner of a square.
They also work similar designs on mantles and coverings which they
make with the bark of the mulberry tree.<a name="FNanchor_3_49" id=
"FNanchor_3_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_49" class=
"fnanchor">[49]</a></p>
</div>

<p>John Smith testifies to the same practices in Virginia as shown
in the following lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>For their apparell, they are sometimes covered with the skinnes
of wilde beasts, which in Winter are dressed with the hayre, but in
Sommer without. The better sort use large mantels of Deare skins,
not much differing in fashion from the Irish mantels. Some
imbrodered with white beads, some with Copper, other painted after
their manner. * * * We haue seene some use mantels made of Turky
feathers, so prettily wrought and woven with threads that nothing
could be discerned but the feathers.<a name="FNanchor_4_50" id=

<p>Through charring by the use of fire in burial rites, and by
contact with copper or preservative salts in burial caves, numerous
pieces of cloth and parts of costumes have come into our
possession. One of the most fertile sources of information has but
recently been made available. The ancient potter employed woven
fabrics in handling, finishing, and decorating pottery. From
mounds, graves, and dwelling sites, all over the country, vases and
sherds are found covered with impressions of these fabrics, and so
well preserved that by taking casts in clay or wax entirely
satisfactory restorations are made. Something may be learned from
the recovery of implements of spinning and weaving, but up to this
time the only relics secured are a few rather rude spindle
whorls.</p>

<p>I shall present in the following paragraphs such portions of the

<div class="center">FABRICS FROM CAVES AND SHELTERS.</div>

<p>At an early date in the history of the country reports began to
find their way into print relating to the discovery of mortuary
fabrics in caverns and shelters. Extracts from some of these
publications may be given.</p>

<p>From the writing of John Haywood historian of Tennessee, we have
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In the spring of the year 1811, was found in a copperas cave in
Warren county, in West Tennessee, about 15 miles southwest from
Sparta, and 20 from McMinnville, the bodies of two human beings,
which had been covered by the dirt or ore from which copperas was
made. One of these persons was a male, the other a female. They
were interred in baskets, made of cane, curiously wrought, and
evidencing great mechanic skill. They were both dislocated at the
hip joint, and were placed erect in the baskets, with a covering
made of cane to fit the baskets in which they were placed. The
flesh of these persons was entire and undecayed, of a brown dryish
colour, produced by time, the flesh having adhered closely to the
bones and sinews. Around the female, next her body, was placed a
well dressed deer skin. Next to this was placed a rug, very
curiously wrought, of the bark of a tree and feathers. The bark
seemed to have been formed of small strands well twisted. Around
each of these strands, feathers were rolled, and the whole woven
into a cloth of firm texture, after the manner of our common coarse
fabrics. This rug was about three feet wide, and between six and
seven feet in length. The whole of the ligaments thus framed of
bark were completely covered with feathers, forming a body of about
one eighth of an inch in thickness, the feathers extending about
one quarter of an inch in length from the strand to which they were
confined. The appearance was highly diversified by green, blue,
yellow and black, presenting different shades of colour when
reflected upon by the light in different positions. The next
covering was an undressed deer skin, around which was rolled, in
good order, a plain shroud manufactured after the same order as the
one ornamented with feathers. This article resembled very much in
its texture the bags generally used for the purpose of holding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="pg030" id="pg030">030</a></span> coffee
exported from Havanna to the United States. The female had in her
hand a fan formed of the tail feathers of a turkey. The points of
these feathers were curiously bound by a buckskin string, well
dressed, and were thus closely bound for about one inch from the
points. About three inches from the point they were again bound, by
another deer skin string, in such a manner that the fan might be
closed and expanded at pleasure. * * *</p>

<p>The cave in which they were found, abounded in nitre, copperas,
alum, and salts. The whole of this covering, with the baskets, was
perfectly sound, without any marks of decay.<a name="FNanchor_1_51"
id="FNanchor_1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_51" class=
"fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>There was also a scoop net made of bark thread; a mockasin made
of the like materials; a mat of the same materials, enveloping
human bones, were found in saltpetre dirt, six feet below the
surface. The net and other things mouldered on being exposed to the
sun.<a name="FNanchor_2_52" id="FNanchor_2_52"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_2_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the year 1815 a remarkably interesting set of mortuary
fabrics was recovered from a saltpeter cave near Glasgow, Kentucky.
A letter from Samuel L. Mitchell, published by the American
Antiquarian Society, contains the following description of the
condition of the human remains and of the nature of its
coverings:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The outer envelope of the body is a deer skin, probably dried in
the usual way, and perhaps softened before its application, by
rubbing. The next covering is a deer skin, whose hair had been cut
away by a sharp instrument, resembling a hatter's knife. The
remnant of the hair, and the gashes in the skin, nearly resemble
the sheared pelt of beaver. The next wrapper of cloth is made of
twine doubled and twisted. But the thread does not appear to have
been formed by the wheel, nor the web by the loom. The warp and
filling seemed to have been crossed and knotted by an operation
like that of the fabricks of the northwest coast, and of the
Sandwich islands. * * * The innermost tegument is a mantle of cloth
like the preceding; but furnished with large brown feathers,
arranged and fastened with great art, so as to be capable of
guarding the living wearer from wet and cold. The plumage is
distinct and entire, and the whole bears a near similitude to the
feathery cloaks now worn by the nations of the northwestern coast
of America.<a name="FNanchor_3_53" id="FNanchor_3_53"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_3_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Bureau of Ethnology had the good fortune to secure recently
a number of representative pieces of burial fabrics of the classes
mentioned in the preceding extracts, and somewhat detailed
descriptions of these will sufficiently illustrate the art as
practiced by the early inhabitants of the middle portions of the
country.</p>

<p>The relics which have come into the possession of the Bureau
were obtained in 1885 by Mr. A. J. McGill from a rock shelter on
"Clifty" or Cliff Creek, Morgan county, Tennessee. Mr. J. W.
Emmert, through whom they were procured, reports that they were
found in a grave 3&frac12; feet below the surface and in earth strongly
charged with niter and perhaps other preservative salts. The more
pliable cloths, together with skeins of vegetal fiber, a dog's
skull, some bone tools, and portions of human bones and hair, were
rolled up in a large split-cane mat. The grave was situated about
as shown in the accompanying section (figure 4). A shelf some 20
feet in width, with depressed floor, occurs <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="pg031" id="pg031">031</a></span> about midway
between the creek bed and the slightly overhanging ledge above, the
whole height being estimated at 300 feet.</p>

<div class="center2">MANTLE OR SKIRT OF LIGHT-COLORED STUFF.</div>

<p>The mat, a very excellent piece of work, is 6 feet 6 inches by 3
feet 4 inches. By reference to plate II it will be seen that it is
neatly and artistically made and quite well preserved. The strands
are from one-third to three-sixteenths of an inch in width and are
even on the edges and smoothly dressed on the back. The hard,
glistening outer surface of the cane is light in color and the
dressed surface is dark naturally or artificially, and the weaving
is so managed that a tasteful border and a checkered effect are
produced by alternately exposing the light and dark sides. This
piece probably <img src="images/fig04.jpg" class="floatRight" alt=
"Fig. 4. Section of cliff showing position of grave shelter." />
very fairly represents the split-cane work of the whole
cane-producing region. A similar piece of work from the gulf coast
is illustrated in figure 12.</p>

<p>Inclosed with the mat were three pieces of fabric of especial
interest, all pertaining, no doubt, to the costume of the person
buried. The piece of cloth shown in plate III probably served as a
mantle or skirt and is 46 inches long by 24 wide. It is of coarse,
pliable, yellowish-gray stuff, woven in the twined style so common
all over America. The fiber was doubtless derived from the native
hemp, and the strands are neatly twisted and about the size of
average wrapping cord. The warp strands, 24 inches in length,
extend across the piece; and on the left margin, as seen in the
illustration, they are looped for the passage of a gathering
string, while on the left they have been cut to form a short
fringe. The opposing series (the woof strands) have been passed
through with the length of the cloth in pairs, which are twisted
half around at each intersection, inclosing the web strands in
alternating pairs as shown in detail in figure 5. These twined
strands are placed three-eights of an inch apart, the web being so
close that the fabric is but slightly open. The twined strands are
carried back and forth in groups of four as shown at the ends in
the plate, and are knotted as illustrated in the figure.</p>

<p>A piece of fabric of much interest is presented in plate IV. It
may be an unfinished garment of the class shown in the preceding
illustration, but it is more likely a complete skirt, the narrow
woven band with its gathering string serving as a belt and the long
fringe being the skirt. The length at the gathered edge is 34
inches, and the pendant length is 20 inches. The material and the
weaving are the same as in the piece of cloth already described,
although the work is somewhat coarser. <span class='pagenum'><a
name="pg032" id="pg032">032</a></span> A detailed study of the border
is given in figure 6, the vertical series of threads being pulled
apart to show more distinctly the manner of combination.</p>

<p>The two pieces just described would seem to correspond pretty
closely with the garments formerly worn by women and girls of the
lower Mississippi</p>

<p>Of equal interest to the preceding is the badly frayed bag shown
in plate V. It is 20 inches in length and 13 inches in depth. The
style of weaving is the same as that of the two preceding examples;
a peculiar open effect is produced by the rotting out of certain
strands of dark color, which were arranged in pairs alternating
with eight lighter threads. The construction of the border or rim
of this bag is quite remarkable. As shown in figure 8, the upper
ends of the vertical <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg034" id=
"pg034">034</a></span> strands are gathered in slightly twisted
groups of four and carried up free for about two inches, when they
are brought together and plaited with remarkable neatness into a
string border. As if to convey to the curious investigator of
modern times a complete knowledge of their weavers' art, the
friends of the dead deposited with the body not only the fabrics
worn during life but a number of skeins of the fiber from which the
fabrics were probably made. This fiber has been identified as that
of the <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, or wild hemp. Two of the skeins are
shown in plate V.</p>

<p>The presence of these unworked materials makes it probable that
the individual burned was a female, for the distaff and the loom
have been and are universal emblems of the practical enslavement of
that sex.</p>

<p><img src="images/fig08.jpg" class="floatLeft" alt=
"Border of bag." /> A small but very instructive group of burial
fabrics is preserved in the National Museum. These specimens were
found with a desiccated body in 1877 in a cave 8 miles from Mammoth
cave, Kentucky. They consist of a number of bags and other articles
woven in the usual styles of bast and hemp. Nearly all of the
articles are worn or fragmentary, but the fiber is wonderfully
preserved and the original colors are as fresh as if the burial had
taken place but yesterday. There are three wide-mouthed, shallow
bags, resembling the one from Tennessee illustrated in plate V. The
largest is 34 inches long when closed, and 15 inches deep. Both web
and woof are of bast. There is a border of open work bound by a
plaited band as seen in figure 8, and the manner of weaving is
identical with that shown in that figure. The second bag is 22
inches long and 16 deep. The web is of bast, the woof of hemp. The
smaller specimen is 14 by 9 inches and is made exclusively of hemp,
and is thus much more pliable than the others. The small remnant of
a larger bag shows a web of heavy, plaited bast strands resembling
the specimen impressed on pottery and shown in <i>a</i>, plate IX.
Besides these pieces there is a bit of heavy, compactly woven
stuff, resembling the broad part of a sling, which shows traces of
a geometric pattern, and a piece of flattish rope 12 feet long and
12 inches broad plaited very neatly of hempen twine.</p>

<p>Among a number of cave relics from Kentucky donated to the
Museum by Mr. Francis Klett, are some textile articles. Among these
is a sandal or moccasin woven or plaited very neatly of bast. It is
shown in <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg035" id=
"pg035">035</a></span>figure 9. Prof. F. W. Putnam and other explorers
of these caves have obtained numerous textile articles of
interest.</p>

<div class="center2">CHARRED REMAINS OF FABRICS FROM MOUNDS.</div>

<p>That the well-preserved fabrics just illustrated represent
fairly the textile work of the mound-builders is practically
demonstrated by the evidence furnished by the mounds themselves.
From hundreds of sources come the same story; and it is not
necessary here to enter into any elaborate discussion of the
subject or to multiply illustrations. I present in plates VI and
VII specimens of mound fabrics which, since they were burned with
the dead, undoubtedly formed part of the clothing of the living or
were wrappings of articles deposited with the bodies. These coarse
cloths may be considered as fairly representing the weaving of the
mound-builders. There are among them some finer examples of weaving
than those obtained from the caves and shelters of Tennessee and
Kentucky, but there is nothing specifically different in material
or methods of combination, and there is nothing whatever to suggest
a higher stage of culture than that of the historic Indian.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img width="100%" src="images/fig09.jpg"
alt="Sandal or moccasin from a Kentucky cave." /></div>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Fig.
9.</span>&mdash;Sandal or moccasin from a Kentucky cave.</div>

<p>The fiber is quite fine and is more probably of hemp than of the
bark of trees. The strands are generally well twisted and even, the
twist being in most cases to the right, or as if twisted on the
thigh with a downward movement of the right-hand, the thread being
held in the left. As in the case of cave fabrics as well as the
work of the modern peoples of the region, the weaving is nearly all
in the twined style, of which there are two varieties; one in which
each strand of the web is in turn inclosed simply by the woof
twisted in pairs, and the other in which alternate pairs of the web
strands are inclosed by the twined pairs of the woof. Cloths woven
in the first method are often quite close, as the woof threads are
readily pressed or pounded down on one another entirely hiding the
web strands, giving a fabric of much compactness and strength. The
second variety is usually some <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg036"
id="pg036">036</a></span>what open and net-like, and very often the
pairs of twined woof strands are placed far apart, as shown in
several of the illustrations given in this paper. The finest mesh
observed is in the first of these styles, and includes about twenty
intersections to the inch.</p>

<p>From the Ohio mounds also there are examples of plain as well as
of diagonal interlacing. In appearance the cloth is much the same
as that done in the twined style. In a few cases a border or
selvage of very simple construction is seen. A looped margin for
the passage of a gathering cord is common.</p>

<p>In plate VI a number of bits of charred cloth are shown; being
quite black the camera fails to give them with clearness, but the
drawings presented in plate VII serve to make clear all details of
the strands and their combination. The charring has taken place in
cremating the dead, in the burning of offerings or through
accidental subjection to heat. In some cases very considerable
portions of the cloth are found, but it is usually in a very
fragile state and little has been preserved.</p>

<p>Specimens preserved in this way are obtained from a large area,
including the Ohio and a large portion of the Mississippi
valleys.</p>

<div class="center2">FABRICS PRESERVED BY CONTACT WITH
COPPER.</div>

<p>The preservation of woven textures through association in
burials with implements or other articles of copper is of common
occurrence. Our museums contain many examples of copper celts
retaining on their <img src="images/fig10.jpg" class="floatLeft"
alt=
"Fine, closely woven cloth preserved by contact with copper beads." />
surfaces portions of cloth so well preserved that the fibers retain
much of their original strength as well as color. In plate VIII
three examples are shown from a mound near Davenport, Iowa, and a
fourth from a mound near Savannah, Georgia. The fabrics on <i>a</i>
and <i>b</i> are of the twined style and, although occurring 800
miles apart, are identical in every respect. The cloth on <i>c</i>
is very closely woven and has the appearance of simple interlacing.
The finest piece of work that has come to my notice is a bit of
cloth from a mound in Pike county, Ohio. It has from thirty-five to
forty strands to the inch, and looks much like coarse twilled
goods. It is woven in the twined style, however, and is therefore
of native origin. It was preserved by contact with a large number
of copper beads, four of which are shown in the cut, figure 10.</p>

<p>Traces of basketry are rarely preserved either by charring or by
contact with copper. Matting is occasionally preserved in these
ways. Figure 11 illustrates a piece of rush matting found fixed to
the surface of a bit of copper in a mound near Augusta,
Georgia.</p>

<p>The weaving of the hair of many species of quadrupeds, the
buffalo, the opossum, the rabbit, etc., is noted by a number of
authors, and a few <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg037" id=
"pg037">037</a></span> specimens of haircloth have been recovered
from mounds. Mr. Henry R. Howland found in a mound near Alton,
Illinois, two varieties of cloth preserved by contact with a copper
ornament representing a turtle-shell; they are described as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Closely fitting over the outer surface of the copper shell is,
first, a woven cloth of a vegetable fibre, similar in its general
character to the outer matting above described, but of a stronger
and better preserved fibre, apparently more like that which forms
the woven coating of the Davenport axes. This is covered in turn
with a softer, finer fabric, now of a dark-brown color, formed of
twisted strands, laid or matted closely together, though apparently
not woven. The material of which these strands are formed proves,
under microscopic examination, to be animal hair.<a name=

<p>An illustration of ancient split cane matting is presented in
figure <img src="images/fig11.jpg" class="floatRight" alt=
"Small portion of rush matting preserved by contact with copper." />
12. The specimen was obtained from Petite Anse island, near
Vermilion bay, southern coast of Louisiana, and a photograph was
presented to the Smithsonian Institution in 1866, by J. F. Cleu. The
following description, as given by Prof. Joseph Henry, appears on
the label attached to the specimen:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This fragment of matting was found near the surface of the salt,
and about 2 feet above it were remains of tusks and bones of a
fossil elephant. The peculiar interest in regard to the specimen is
in its occurrence in situ 2 feet below the elephant remains, and
about 14 feet below the surface of the soil, thus showing the
existence of mart on the island prior to the deposit in the soil of
the fossil elephant. The material consists of the outer bark of the
common southern cane (<i>Arundinaria macrosperma</i>), and has been
preserved for so long a period both by its silicious character and
the strongly saline condition of the soil.</p>
</div>

<div class="center">FABRICS IMPRESSED ON POTTERY.</div>

<p>It was a common practice among the aborigines to employ woven
fabrics in the construction and ornamentation of earthenware.
Impressions were thus left on the clay, and by baking these were
rendered as lasting as if engraved on stone.</p>

<p>From no other source do we obtain so wide a range of fabrics.
The fabric-marked vases and sherds are obtained from mounds,
graves, and village sites all over the country. There is not a
state within the Mississippi or Atlantic drainage that does not
furnish some example of the preservation of native fabric
impressions on earthenware. The perfection with which every
character of these textures is preserved is well shown in a number
of the figures here introduced.</p>

<p>A somewhat extended study of this subject was published in the
Third Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, and illustrations
of nearly all the styles of weaving were given. As indicated by
subsequent <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg038" id=
"pg038">038</a></span>investigations, a number of slight inaccuracies
of analysis and drawing occur in that paper, but they are of such
minor importance that detailed correction is unnecessary.</p>

alt="Portion of mantle showing manner of weaving." /></div>

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Fig.

Louisiana.</div>

<p>It would seem that imprints of cloth woven in the plain
interlaced style appear to be quite rare, although it is difficult,
from the impressions on clay, to distinguish this from other forms
when the threads are closely impacted. In somewhat rare cases the
interlacing is so arranged and alternated as to give diagonal
effects as in a specimen shown in figure 13. These effects are
peculiar to the interlaced fabrics, not being produced in twined or
netted work.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that vessels of clay were often modeled in
baskets, and that the native earthenware preserved numerous
impressions of baskets. On closer analysis these impressions turn
out to be the application of pliable cloths, or of cords singly or
in groups, or of stamps covered with textiles or having geometric
textile-like patterns engraved on them. I can not recall a single
example from eastern United States in which it is entirely clear
that the clay vessel was modeled in a basket. The impressions of
basket work occasionally seen are only partial, having been applied
after the vessel was practically finished.</p>

<p>Twined weaving prevails in the fabrics impressed on pottery as
in those from all other aboriginal sources. An example of the
simplest <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg040" id=
"pg040">040</a></span> form, obtained from a small fragment of
pottery found in Polk county, Tennessee, is shown in figure 16. Two
series of threads are interwoven at right angles, the warp being
arranged in pairs and the woof singly.</p>

<p>At each intersection the pairs of warp threads are twisted half
around upon themselves, inclosing the woof threads and holding them
quite firmly, so that the open net-like effect is well preserved
even under strain or in long continued use. There are many
varieties of this form of fabric resulting from differences in size
and spacing of the threads. These differences are well brought out
in the succeeding figures.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="pg041" id="pg041">041</a></span> The
impression is quite perfect. The cords are somewhat uneven, and
seem to have been only moderately well twisted. They were probably
made of hemp fiber. It will be observed that the threads of the web
are placed at regular intervals, while those of the woof are
irregularly placed. It may be noticed that in one case the woof has
not been doubled, the single thread having, as a consequence,
exactly the same relation to the opposing series as corresponding
threads in simple interlacing. The impression, of which this is
only a part, indicates that the cloth used in shaping the vessel
was considerably distorted when applied to the soft clay.</p>

<p>Nowhere else are found so many fine impressions of fabrics on
clay vessels as in the ancient salt-making localities of the
Mississippi valley. The huge bowls or vats used by the primitive
salt-maker have generally been modeled in coarse, open fabrics, or
have had cloths impressed upon them for ornament. In figures 18 and
19 fine examples of these impressions are given. The latter
engraving illustrates a specimen in which every detail is perfectly
preserved. Only a small portion of the original is shown in the
cut. It is noticeable that the cords are quite heavy and well
twisted, although the spacing is somewhat irregular.</p>

example given in figure 20, impressed on a fragment of clay from
Arkansas, has an ornamental border produced by looping the cords of
the web, which seem to have been five in number, each one passing
over four others before recrossing the frame. A specimen showing a
somewhat different border is given in figure 21.</p>

<p>The interesting specimen illustrated in figure 22 was obtained
from a small fragment of pottery found in Ripley county, Missouri.
The <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg043" id="pg043">043</a></span>
combination of the two series of strands clearly indicates the type
of fabric, the twisted cords of the woof being placed very far
apart. The warp is of braid formed by plaiting strands of untwisted
fiber, probably bast. All the details are shown in the most
satisfactory manner in the clay cast.</p>

<p>In figure 23 we have a similar fabric closely woven or impacted.
I have made the drawing to show fillets of fiber appearing at the
ends; these do not appear in the impression. It is highly probable,
however, that these fillets are plaited bands, as in the preceding
example. They are wide and flat, giving somewhat the effect of
basket-work of splints or rushes.</p>

<p>Another variety of the twined fabrics, distinguished by
peculiarities in the combinations of the threads, is illustrated in
figures 24 and 25. The threads of the warp are arranged in pairs as
in the specimens <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg044" id=
"pg044">044</a></span> already described, but are twisted in such a
way as to inclose two of the opposing series instead of one, each
succeeding pair of warp threads taking up alternate pairs of the
woof threads. Figure 25 is from a small piece of pottery exhumed
from a mound on Fain island, Jefferson county, Tennessee. The
threads of the woof are quite close together, those of the web
being far apart.</p>

<p>That the native love of decoration had a marked influence on the

well</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="pg045" id="pg045">045</a></span>
evinced even in the meager vestiges brought to light by researches
in the mounds. Decorative borders and fanciful combinations of
strands are shown in some of the preceding cuts, and figure 26,
copied from a pottery fragment obtained in the Ohio valley,
indicates a more ambitious attempt at embellishment. The fabric was
evidently of ornate design and the execution excellent.</p>

<p>Plate IX is intended to convey a clear notion of the nature and
appearance of fabric-marked pottery and of the manner of securing
positive impressions in clay. Three bits of pottery from Illinois
are placed at the left, and the three casts appear at the right.

<div class="center2"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>&mdash;Net
from ancient pottery, North Carolina.</div>

<p>Nets were in use by the Indians of Florida and Virginia at the
time of the discovery, and the ancient pottery of the Atlantic
states has preserved impressions of innumerable specimens. The
piece shown in figure 27 is from a small fragment of pottery picked
up in the District of Columbia. The impression is so perfect that
the twist of the cord and the form of the knot may be seen with
ease. Most of the examples from this locality are of much finer
cord and have a less open mesh than the specimen illustrated. The
net illustrated in figure 28 is from a specimen of North Carolina
pottery. Netting of this class was still in use among the natives
of the Chesapeake region when the English colonies were
founded.</p>

<p>The lesson of the prehistoric textile art of eastern United
States is simple and easily read, and goes far to round out the
story of native occupation and culture. Colonial records furnish
definite knowledge of the woven fabrics and weaving of the nations
first encountered by the whites. Graves, mounds, and caves give us
an insight into the pre-Columbian status of the art, and evidence
furnished by associated industries which happen to echo features of
the textile art contribute to our information. Charred cloths from
the great mounds are identical in material, combination of parts,
and texture with the <span class='pagenum'><a name="pg046" id=
"pg046">046</a></span> fabrics of the simple savage. Cloths preserved
by contact with copper implements and ornaments characteristic of
the art of the builders of the mounds do not differ in any way from
the humble work of the historic peoples. All tell the same story of
a simple, primitive culture, hardly advanced beyond the grade
separating the savage from the barbarous condition.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
